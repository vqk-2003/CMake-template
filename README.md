# My Modern CMake template

- This repository was created for the purpose of learning Modern CMake.
- The usage directory is not a part of the library, it just to show how to consume the library.
- Feedback is welcome!

# Recommendation

I honestly don't recommend copying this template. For an overview of what a modern C++ project should look like, checkout [ModernCppStarter](https://github.com/TheLartians/ModernCppStarter).
